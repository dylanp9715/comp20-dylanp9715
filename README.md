1) The purpose of this Git repository is to store the set of files for our assignments, as well as the history of the changes we made to those files.

2) My favorite assignment was the MBTA project. This was my first time interacting with an API. It was very rewarding to see my code interact with such a widely used tool. In addition, this was one of the first assignments in which I saw incremental growth as every little change I made to the code had a recognizable impact on the web page. 

3) I think I have grown tremendously since day 1. I have learned so many new tools and am very happy with the progress I have made.

4) The most important thing I learned in this course is how to look things up. My first example would be the MBTA project. This assignment essentially required that I look up how to interact with the Google Maps API. My second example would be the final group project. As we have now shifted our focus onto more complex API's and issues, Stack Overflow and Google have become vital tools to solving each problem we've been give (ex. having styling sheet transfer when deploying to heroku).

5) I would like to delve deeper into cybersecurity.
